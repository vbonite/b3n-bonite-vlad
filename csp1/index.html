					<h2>The Organization</h2>
					<p>The University of the Philippines Circle of Industrial Engineering Majors (UP CIEM) is a duly recognized academic organization based under the Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, College of Engineering, UP Diliman. Upholding the holistic development of its members, UP CIEM consistently made its mark through rendering service to the college, the university and the country.

					The organization has a clear vision for its members. First, to notice that the organization is more than just a collection of people. Next is, to realize that being a member of CIEM gives them the the opportunity to discover the boundaries of their personality and become an even better version of themselves. And lastly, to be humble, not one that bows their head and keeps their opinion to themselves, but one who has dignity and is able to stand and lead a crowd without having to step on another person. More than being an organization, UP CIEM continues to be the family of camaraderie and trust for the Industrial Engineering student body and the sanctuary of excellent Industrial Engineers for the nation's future. 

					This is UP CIEM - One Circle, One Family.</p>

						<h2>History</h2>
						<p>The University of the Philippines Circle of Industrial Engineering Majors (UP CIEM) was established on November 23, 1976 by a group of students from the Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, College of Engineering at the University of the Philippines, Diliman (UP Diliman). Over the years, UP CIEM has grown from a fledging organization to a force that reckoned with not only in academics but in sports, social activities and leadership as well. The business of UP CIEM never falls short of the foundations of Industrial Engineering - effectiveness, efficiency, and productivity. 

						With 38 years of significant existence in the UP College of Engineering, UP CIEM chooses no other path but to advance excellence in the grandest manner. UP CIEM remains true to its foundation, providing an organization of support, assistance and relationships to the students.</p>

				<h2>Events</h2>
				<p>The initial ambition for the first IEshikawa was for it to be a seminar series which would reinforce the pre-existing acumen of industrial engineering students hailing from universities from the National Capital Region. Now, the next installment will accomodate more than 1000 participants from Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao and it will not only review students of the prior know-how but the 10th instalment will impart unconventional insights and mystery on industrial engineering.</p>
